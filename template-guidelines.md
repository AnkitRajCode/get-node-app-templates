## Template guidelines

Following guidelines must be followed while making a new template.

- The new template should not exist in the repo i.e if express+ejs app exists then one should not add any new template related to express+ejs however one can add express+ejs+mongodb template
- **Naming the template**: The template name must be short and descriptive and separated by `-` (hyphen). Have a look at the naming pattern of existing templates.
- **Template contents**:
    - normal files as usual to make the template work
    - **.gitignore**: you can pickup `.gitignore` file from any exiting template but make sure the content is as per your template
    - **README.md**: should contain how to get the app running
    - Make sure to not include any personal info like email id and stuff (in package.json)
